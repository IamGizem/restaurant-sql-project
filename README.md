# Restaurant SQL Project

This project is based on a sample restaurant database containing two main tables: `menu_items` and `order_details`. The goal is to analyze menu performance and customer order behavior using SQL queries.

## Files

- `menu_items.sql`: Contains queries or table structure related to menu items.
- `order_details.sql`: Contains queries or table structure related to order details.
- `combine.sql`: Includes queries that combine both tables using JOINs and perform data analysis.

## Database

- MySQL (executed via MySQL Workbench)

## Objectives

- Analyze sales performance of menu items.
- Understand customer ordering patterns.
- Practice SQL skills such as SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and filtering.
